# Hamburger Audio Plugin
If you are a musician who wants to use this plugin, please download the binaries from [my store page](https://ko-fi.com/s/6e7ded34dc).

Hamburger is a distortion plugin with inbuilt dynamics controls and equalisation that can deliver both subtle tangy harmonics and absolute annihilation and noise-wall-ification to any sound.

</p>

If you need control over your distortion tone, you can carve and refine your sound resulting in extremely unique timbres. Compress and shape the dynamics of your sound before distorting to make your synths and instruments punchy and juicy. You can provide subtle flare, texture and grit to a sound that didn't have one. You can also hit the pedal to the metal, go crazy with the knobs and enter sonic territories that other distortion plugins would be TERRIFIED to enter. 



# Download

Hamburger is supported for Windows, Linux (x86_64) and both Apple Silicon and Intel MacOS devices, in VST3 / CLAP / AU / LV2 formats.

# Overview

- Several distortion modules:
    - Grill Saturation (with wavefolding, diode clipping and adjustable bias for asymmetric saturation)
    - Tube Emulation (my take on Class A tube emulation, with extra parameters such as Jeff (?) and controllable bias)
    - Phase Distortion (for watery slick tones, adds interesting harmonics in a controllable way)
    - Rubidium Distortion (dynamic and delicious module that extends the laws of physics of a transformer saturation model)
    - Matrix Distortion (an entirely random assortment of waveshaping functions for your pleasure)
    - Tape Distortion (A tape hysteresis model written by [Jatin Chowdhury](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/ComplexNonlinearities/tree/master) (thank you üôè) enhanced with extra features)
    - Clipper at the end of the chain to help with controlling unnecessary peaks, and for your own safety :D

- Pre-filtering effects
    - Smooth and responsive allpass chain to add phase shifting to signal
    - Grunge (resonant filtering). Good on guitars, makes the distortion more grimey.

- Adjust dynamics before distorting:
    - Stereo Compressor (with adjustable stereo link to create a dual mono compressor)
    - Multiband (with optional downwards compression) 
    - Mid/Side Compressor (for taming arbitrary stereo content)

- Add grit and noise to the signal with:
    - Sizzle (tries to impart white noise into zero crossings of signal)
    - Digital Erosion (inspired by Ableton's Erosion effect)
    - Downsampling and Bit Reduction (digital bitcrush)
    - Hard Gate (harsh and loud)
    - Fizz (white noise layer)

- 2 Band Emphasis EQ to tone and shape the signal before and after distortion
- Option to duplicate current distortion layer (stacking up to 8x) for even more powerful and dynamic behaviour
- Oversampling support to reduce aliasing artifacts

## Building

To build Hamburger from source, you'll need:
- CMake 3.15 or later
- A C++17 compatible compiler
- Git

### Quick Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Davit-G/Hamburger.git
cd Hamburger
```

2. Configure step:
```bash
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

3. Build the project:
```bash
cmake --build build --config Release
```

The built plugins will be automatically copied to:
- **macOS**: `../build_mac/`
