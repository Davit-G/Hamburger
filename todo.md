# Must

support mono / stereo only, dont have it break on mono
performance optimisations
pluginval

# Should

visual volume indicator? (vu meter and/or bars for peak / lufs)
give tube more character

# Would be nice

add more dist types


# ONCE DSP and layout HAS BEEN FINALISED:
svgs or images on knobs to show interesting visuals?
make a credits panel that shows up on the entire screen


# Feedback:

Mix knob on bit noise and gate noise
sizzle noise does seem to crap out a bit when using higher fuzz values. at some point it started generating a constant stream of white noise that was pretty loud... long after the note ended
phase distortion doesn't seem to do a lot? not sure how it works
