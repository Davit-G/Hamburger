Must

support mono / stereo only, dont have it break on mono
performance optimisations
pluginval

Should

visual volume indicator? (vu meter and/or bars for peak / lufs)
give tube more character

Would be nice

add more waveshaper stuff to grill
post filtering (filtered tone sounds better than regular one? idk)
replicate / improve bias dc behaviour better


ONCE DSP and layout HAS BEEN FINALISED:
svgs or images on knobs to show interesting visuals?
make a credits panel that shows up on the entire screen



feedback:

Mix knob on bit noise and gate noise
breaks on multiple channels
