Must

oversampling
performance optimisations
check back on mac notarisation and codesigning
pluginval

Should

visual volume indicator? (vu meter and/or bars for peak / lufs)
give tube more character
antialiasing on logo

Would be nice

add more waveshaper stuff to grill
support other sample rates / more channels?
post filtering (filtered tone sounds better than regular one? idk)
replicate / improve bias dc behaviour better


ONCE DSP and layout HAS BEEN FINALISED:
svgs or images on knobs to show interesting visuals?
make a credits panel that shows up on the entire screen



feedback:

Antialiasing on hamburger logo is ham
Make proper tube tone before the distortion
Reduce the range of the bias knob (negative values nah man)
Emphasis eq panel isnt intuitive, replace with two peaks across the entire band, and separate them with a divider, and add a label on the top for band 1 band 2 or smth
Mix knob on bit noise and gate noise
q range above halfway is useless (1/value)
s-link useless
breaks on multiple channels
