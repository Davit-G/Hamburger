Must

oversampling
performance optimisations
pluginval

Should

visual volume indicator? (vu meter and/or bars for peak / lufs)
give tube more character
antialiasing on logo

Would be nice

add more waveshaper stuff to grill
support other sample rates / more channels?
post filtering (filtered tone sounds better than regular one? idk)
replicate / improve bias dc behaviour better


ONCE DSP and layout HAS BEEN FINALISED:
svgs or images on knobs to show interesting visuals?
make a credits panel that shows up on the entire screen



feedback:

Antialiasing on hamburger logo is ham
Emphasis eq panel isnt intuitive, separate eq bits with a divider, and add a label on the top for band 1 band 2 or smth
Mix knob on bit noise and gate noise
breaks on multiple channels
