Must

support mono / stereo only, dont have it break on mono
performance optimisations
pluginval

Should

visual volume indicator? (vu meter and/or bars for peak / lufs)

Would be nice

add more dist types
replicate / improve bias dc behaviour better on tube


ONCE DSP and layout HAS BEEN FINALISED:
svgs or images on knobs to show interesting visuals?

feedback:

Mix knob on bit noise and gate noise
